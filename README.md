### Description of files submitted:

- `config.yaml`: this file stores the initial setuo of the model
- `data.py`: this file includes data preprocessing functions
- `main.py`: this file is for execution, since we put our major execution steps in the enotebook, this is just a file for reference
- `neuralnet.py`: this is the main file for implementing the neural network
- `train.py`: this file records the experimentation methods and training steps
- `PA2.ipynb`: we use this notebook for modelling, implementing, experimenting an plotting


### Instructions of running the code:
We put our codes in the ipynb notebook, so just running the PA2.ipynb could do.
